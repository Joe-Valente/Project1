  <h1>How I got into Servers</h1>

  <p>Everyone loves minecraft, I am no exception, its a game that has had a massive impact on the lives of my generation, it is a true classic, and will be well recorded and remembered far down the lines of history, how does this relate to servers?</p>
  <p>Well, I got my first computer when I was roughly 12, it was a 2014 macbook air, and it served me very well, throughout most of highschool, the next pieces of tech I received were a raspberry pi, 90's era HP Pavilion Slimline, and a lenovo desktop tower,</p>
  <p>Sometime, around the end of my senior of highschool I was introduced to Linux servers, and decided to put my old computer's to use, on the Slimline I started a plex media server for my home network, which isnt very important. On the Lenovo, I put a minecraft server just like the one in the video posted above.</p>
  <p>Currently neither are in operation as my parents don't like the idea of me running machines they dont understand out of their basement which is very understandable, but I've been learning best practices and currently enjoy upgrading small elements of the computers.</p>
  <p>I hope to eventually be able to get a hold of a large server chassis and some spare server equipment to potentially make sandbox for me to learn with, enjoy, and take on bigger projects with.</p>
