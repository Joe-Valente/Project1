    <h1>How I got into Servers</h1>

    <p>Everyone loves minecraft&comma; I am no exception&comma; it&apos;s a game that has had a massive impact on the lives of my generation&period; It is a true classic&comma; and will be well recorded and remembered far down the lines of history&comma; how does this relate to servers&quest;</p>
    <p>Well&comma; I got my first computer when I was roughly 12&comma; it was a 2014 macbook air&comma; and it served me very well&comma; throughout most of highschool&comma; the next pieces of tech I received were a raspberry pi&comma; 90's era HP Pavilion Slimline&comma; and a lenovo desktop tower&comma;</p>
    <p>Sometime&comma; around the end of my senior of highschool I was introduced to Linux servers&comma; and decided to put my old computer&apos;s to use&comma; on the Slimline I started a plex media server for my home network&comma; which isnt very important&period; On the Lenovo&comma; I put a minecraft server just like the one in the video posted above&period;</p>
    <p>Currently neither are in operation as my parents don't like the idea of me running machines they dont understand out of their basement which is very understandable&comma; but I&apos;ve been learning best practices and currently enjoy upgrading small elements of the computers&period;</p>
    <p>I hope to eventually be able to get a hold of a large server rack and some spare server equipment to potentially make sandbox for me to learn with&comma; enjoy&comma; and take on bigger projects with&period;</p>
