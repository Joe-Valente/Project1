    <h1>Anime, Books, and Movies, Oh My!</h1>
    <p>As a kid I grew up watching anime and cartoons in most of my freetime, shows such as Naruto, and bleach. Naruto being one of my favorites due to the nostalgia that I have for it</p>

    <p>Along with Anime I also consume a heavy amount of literature, the fantasy genre contains most of my favorite go to novels.</p>
    <p>From a very young age I was obsessed with obsurd monsters with complex powers, and magical entities, I love wizard archetypes</p>
    <p>It would only make sense that Authors such as J.R.R Tolkein, Terry Brooks, and Leigh Bardugo would often find their way into my reading pile</p>

    <p>As a young adult I grew to love comics such as: Chris Farley, John Candy, and Gene Wilder, I learned to value older films for what they were as snapshots of their era.</p>
    <p>Some of My Favorite Movies Include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blazing Saddles</li>
      <li>Rear Window</li>
      <li>Young Frankenstein</li>
      <li>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</li>
      <li>Little Shop of Horrors</li>
      <li>Space Balls</li>
    </ul>
