    <p>As a kid I grew up watching anime and cartoons in most of my freetime, shows such as Naruto, and bleach. Naruto being one of my favorites due to the nostalgia that I have for it</p>

    <p>Along with Anime I also consume a heavy amount of literature, the fantasy genre contains most of my favorite go to novels.</p>
    <p>From a very young age I was obsessed with obsurd monsters with complex powers, and magical entities, I love wizard archetypes</p>
    <p>It would only make sense that Authors such as J.R.R Tolkein, Terry Brooks, and Leigh Bardugo would often find their way into my reading pile</p>
